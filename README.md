This project aims to develop a robust offline quiz management system with a user-friendly interface for conducting quizzes.
Participants interact with the system through a Tkinter-based graphical interface, answering questions that are dynamically loaded from a MySQL database.
The system is designed to handle gaps in question IDsâ€”allowing it to display all available questions seamlessly, even if some entries have been removed.
This solution supports secure answer submission, real-time scoring, and provides an efficient and engaging way to manage quiz sessions without requiring an internet connection.
